# Auth0 CycleJS Starter Seed

This sample demonstrates how to create a basic Cycle application.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo or download it from the Cycle quickstart page in Auth0's documentation.

```bash
cd 00-Starter-Seed
npm install
```

## Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Useful commands

- `npm run build` to build the application once for production (minimized).
- `npm start` to start the application dev-server on port 3000.
- `npm run sync` to synchronize NPM dependencies with package.json.
- `npm run watch` to build the application and watch for changes.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-and-domain).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
