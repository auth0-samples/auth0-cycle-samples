# Auth0 CycleJS Login
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/community-driven-brightgreen.svg"/> <br>

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a Cycle application with Auth0. The sample makes use of Auth0's hosted login page which provides centralized authentication.

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box.

Clone the repo or download it from the Cycle quickstart page in Auth0's documentation.

```bash
cd 01-Login
npm install
```

#### Set the Client ID and Domain

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.js.example` file to `auth0-variables.js` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there. This file is located in the `src` directory.

**Set Up `Allowed Origins (CORS)` and `Allowed Callback URLs` in the dashboard**

Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to `Allowed Origins (CORS)` and to `Allowed Callback URLs` in your app dashboard on Auth0.

#### Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Useful commands

- `npm run build` to build the application once for production (minimized)
- `npm start` to start the application dev-server on port 3000
- `npm run sync` to synchronize NPM dependencies with package.json
- `npm run watch` to build the application and watch for changes

#### Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-and-domain).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.
